    "#### About the code:\n",
    "This code performs a regression task using a Random Forest algorithm to predict the diameter at breast height (TreeDBH_cm) of trees based on some features. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import necessary libraries:\n",
    "   - `pandas` is imported as `pd` for data manipulation.\n",
    "   - `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "   - `RandomForestRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble` is the regression model used.\n",
    "   - `mean_absolute_error` from `sklearn.metrics` is used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load the dataset:\n",
    "   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file located at '/home/sushil/Desktop/F2F/data_for_assignment.csv' into a pandas DataFrame named `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocessing:\n",
    "   - Categorical variables are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding. This is done using the `pd.get_dummies()` function, where the column 'Tree species' is one-hot encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y):\n",
    "   - The features (`X`) are obtained by dropping the 'TreeDBH_cm' column from the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - The target variable (`y`) is set to the 'TreeDBH_cm' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Split the data into training and testing sets:\n",
    "   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`, with 80% of the data used for training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and 20% for testing (`X_test`, `y_test`). The parameter `random_state` is set to 42 for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model training:\n",
    "   - A Random Forest regression model is instantiated with `RandomForestRegressor()` and trained on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) using the `fit()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Predictions:\n",
    "   - The trained model is then used to make predictions on the testing features (`X_test`) using the `predict()` method, resulting in predicted values (`y_pred`).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Evaluation:\n",
    "   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. MAE measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. The calculated MAE is then printed out."

    "#### About the code\n",
    "This code calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from two input raster files containing near-infrared (NIR) and red band data. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import Libraries:\n",
    "   - `numpy` is imported as `np` for numerical operations.\n",
    "   - `rasterio` is imported for reading and writing raster files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Function Definition (`calculate_ndvi`):\n",
    "   - This function takes three arguments: `red_file`, `nir_file`, and `output_file`, representing the file paths for the red band, NIR band, and the output NDVI file, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Opening Raster Files:\n",
    "   - The red and NIR bands are opened using `rasterio.open()`.\n",
    "   - The `with` statement is used to ensure proper closing of the raster files after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reading Band Data:\n",
    "   - The red and NIR bands are read as arrays using `.read(1)` (assuming single-band images) and converted to `np.float32` data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Masking Nodata Values:\n",
    "   - Nodata values in the red and NIR bands are identified and replaced with `np.nan` (Not a Number) to exclude them from calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculating NDVI:\n",
    "   - NDVI is calculated using the formula: {(NIR - Red)}/{(NIR + Red)}.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Writing NDVI to Output File:\n",
    "   - The metadata (profile) of the red band raster is copied to ensure consistency.\n",
    "   - The datatype of the output raster is set to `rasterio.float32`.\n",
    "   - The NDVI array is written to the output file using `rasterio.open()` in write mode (`'w'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Example Usage:\n",
    "   - An example call to the `calculate_ndvi` function is provided, specifying the file paths for the red band, NIR band, and the output NDVI file."
